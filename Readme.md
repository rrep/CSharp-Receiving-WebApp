Receiving Subsystem for a Web-Based CRM written in C# on the ASP.Net web framework.

This application will access outstanding orders, and allow a user to modify inventory levels in a transaction by receiving a shipment. If the order is filled, it will be closed in the database. The application will also create entries for additional items that were not listed on the original order.
